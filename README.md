# Decision Tree Implementation

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a Decision Tree using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn. Decision Trees are powerful tools for classification and regression tasks, widely used in data science and machine learning.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
# decision-tree-without-libraries
